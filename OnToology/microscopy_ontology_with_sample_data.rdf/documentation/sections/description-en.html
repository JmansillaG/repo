<h2 id="desc" class="list">Microscopy Fluorescence Ontology: Description <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h2>

<span class="markdown">The purpose of this ontology is to formally represent knowledge about microscopy imaging, including image acquisition, image properties, channels, fluorophores, samples, and processing workflows.
The ontology aims to enable semantic annotation, interoperability, and reasoning over microscopy datasets, especially in contexts such as fluorescence microscopy, confocal imaging, and digital image analysis.</span>
